# Pizza Place App

Pizza Place is a mock ecommerce site for ordering pizza online. Pizza Place utilizes React to manage state items such as quantities, prices, menu items, and order customizations. I use React Router to navigate between components and Google Firebase to handle order options and current order status. The Stripe package is implemented to simulate credit card payments.
